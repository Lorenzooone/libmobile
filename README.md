libmobile
=========

Library that implements the [Mobile Adapter GB](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mobile_Game_Boy_Adapter) protocol, in a way that should be easy to integrate into a plethora of different emulators/hardware projects/etc.

This implementation prides itself in being the most complete recreation of the adapter, for which a lot of the research published on [Dan Docs](https://shonumi.github.io/dandocs.html#magb) has been made.


Documentation
-------------

This library is currently documented through its primary header file, [mobile.h](mobile.h). For an example project using it, you can refer to [libmobile-bgb](https://github.com/REONTeam/libmobile-bgb).
